# MapMyMeals
Map My Meals is an iOS application that enables users to save and review restaurants they've been to before as pins on a map. Never forget your favorite (or least favorite) restaurants again!

The user is able to review their restaurants with dates, summaries, ratings, and photos. They are also able to see their current location and pins of surrounding saved restaurants on a map. They're also able to look up nearby restaurants. 

This app was made using Swift. For Apple Frameworks, it uses UIKit for the interface, CoreLocation and MapKit for location services, and PhotoKit for photos. It also uses Firebase Database and Firebase Authentication, Sign In with Google, and the Yelp API to retrieve existing reviews and ratings.
